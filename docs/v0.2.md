# BlackTent v0.2  

## Trust Hardening & Auditability


**Status:** Planned  

**Scope:** Incremental hardening of the v0.1 core  

**Non-goal:** Feature expansion, integrations, or workflow automation


---


## Overview


BlackTent v0.2 focuses on **making trust visible and auditable**.


v0.1 established a stable output contract and a safe, local-first bundling model for AI or human handoff.  

v0.2 strengthens that foundation by answering one question unambiguously:


> **“What exactly left my laptop — and how do I verify it?”**


This release prioritizes **clarity, determinism, and inspectability** over automation or convenience.

## Design Principles


v0.2 adheres to the following principles:


1. **Conservative by default**  

   Riskier content is excluded unless explicitly opted in.


2. **Auditable over clever**  

   Users should be able to reason about bundle contents without guessing.


3. **Deterministic behavior**  

   The same inputs and flags produce the same bundle structure and manifest.


4. **No trust theater**  

   BlackTent explains what it does and does not protect against.


5. **Small, sharp CLI**  

   If a feature makes it harder to mentally model the bundle, it does not belong in v0.2.
